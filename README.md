## Usage

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### GitHub Pages Deployment

The standard GitHub Pages deployment is pretty easy. Follow these steps to get a configured auto-updatable online portfolio:

1. Generate your [personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with repo access if you haven't already.
2. Fork this project and create a new repository secret with name `API_TOKEN_GITHUB`. Copy here your personal token.
3. Create a repository named `<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io` if you haven't already (the repository should be empty).
4. Edit the .env file.
5. Edit the markdown files in `src/assets`.
6. Change (or just remove) the `public/logo.png` image.
7. Push your changes to the `master` branch if you have worked with a local copy of your `cv-materializer` repository.
8. Profit! (In a few minutes you can access your online portfolio on `https://<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io` or your custom domain).

Extra: Before triggering the deployment, you can add additional things, like `Google Analytics`, to the `<HEAD>` section, by defining a new repository secret `REACT_APP_EXTRA`.

### Development and Manual Deployment

If you have [git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js 8.0+](https://nodejs.org/en/download) already installed, you can follow these steps to get a local copy for development, testing or manual deployment:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/scifier/cv-materializer
cd cv-materializer
npm install
```

Before starting/building the project follow these steps:

1. Edit the .env file.
2. Edit the markdown files in `src/assets`.
3. Change (or just remove) the `public/logo.png` image.

Extra: You can add additional things, like `Google Analytics`, to the `<HEAD>` section, by creating a `.env.local` file with following contents:

```html
REACT_EDITOR=code
REACT_APP_EXTRA=<!-- Global site tag (gtag.js) - Google Analytics --><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=Your_Tracking_ID"></script><script>window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', 'Your_Tracking_ID');</script>
```

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run start

# Build the application by running
npm run build
```

After building the application just copy all the files from `build` to the root directory of your server.
